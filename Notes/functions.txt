fuctions :
 A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.

(a block of code that execute on the certain condition i.e you have to call 
the fuction then only it will execute.)

--Suppose you need to create a program to create a circle and color it. 
You can create two functions to solve this problem:
1 function to draw the circle
2 function to color the circle
Dividing a complex problem into smaller chunks makes your program easy to understand and reusable.

1.// Declaring a Function

 The syntax to declare a function is:

function functionName () {
    //code  
}
 --A function is declared using the function keyword.
 The basic rules of naming a function are similar to naming a variable.
  It is better to write a descriptive name for your function. For example, 
  if a function is used to add two numbers, you could name the function add or addNumbers.
The body of function is written within {}.

For example

// declaring a function named greet()
function greet() {
    console.log("Hello there");
}

2.// Calling a Function
In the above program, we have declared a function named greet(). 
To use that function, we need to call it.
Here's how you can call the above greet() function.

// function call
greet();

3.// Function Parameters
A function can also be declared with parameters. 
A parameter is a value that is passed when declaring a function.
